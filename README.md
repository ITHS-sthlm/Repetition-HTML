**Images**

Good to know:
- In first hand use landscape images and lastly portrait
- Always use a photo editor to compress the image
- Most common images is jpg, png
- If the image is to big in size, adjust it then export and compress
- Consider to choose images that is centered already (the object to be visible on the site)
- Use CSS and rgba to change opacity/transparence to make the image darker etc because you may need text above (house project example)

- NEVER use text above the image (in-built in the image), because of px sensitivity
- Stay organized and have the images in a img folder
- Always use alt or title as attributes to describe the image
- If there is a video element use title attribute
- Better to use high resolution from the start than opposite
